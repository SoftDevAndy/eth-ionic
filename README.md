# eth-ionic
A basic ionic app using the latest version of ionic and taking advantage of many features the framework provides.

Through learning the latest version of AngularJS (v4) the latest version of Ionic (v3) is built upon that platform. Angular and Ionic have moved more towards Typescript so this project is different to something you would see programmed in version 1 of Ionic. This project took a few days to complete and served as a great platform to apply newly learned concepts and skills.

# What is the app?

Displays the current price of Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin 

Also..

The app is a simple android reminder application that lets you create a unique reminder for Ethereum, Bitcoin or Litecoin. If the coin value in USD drops or rises beyond the range you set for the reminder a toast is presented, a sound signals and the reminder switches off.
Simples!
